<h2>Top genres of 2010</h2>

<h2>Top genres of 2019</h2>

<p>Using this data we can see one interesting trend in which every single year the top genre has been <em>dance pop</em>, with an average of more than 20 of the top songs of each year being included in this genre. Dance pop in itself peaked in 2016, with in the later years it slowly became less relavant. Another interesting point to notice is that in a majority of the years the second most popular genre is either one variation of pop or hip-hop which tells us that in the 2010-2019 year span, there was a big culture around the genres of pop, dance pop, and hip-hop. At the beginning of the decade, we can note that dance pop began strong, giving us a little more than 40 of the top 100 songs were classified as dance pop, and as the end of the decade we can see this number dwindle it a little over 20. This can indicade a culture shift at the later point of the decade, with dance pop becoming a less prevalant genre, being slowly overtaken by pop, followed by melodic rap. </p>
<p>I chose to use a bar graph in order to visualize this difference for the fact that it is easy to see the clear differences side by side in descending order of popular genres. One challenge was whether to include each indivual genre or to lump them together into other groups for example whether to combine <em>Chicago Rap</em> with <em>Florida Rap</em> however, in order keep the integrity of the results and to show the extreme variation in music taste and genre I chose to keep the genres as they were. Gathering popular songs and analyzing them is a popular method of analyzing and identifying trends. </p>
<p>One thing that changed how I approached analyzing this data is how I grouped the data, I grouped the data by the top 100 songs per year. I could have grouped the data by genre as opposed to the top songs per year, which is something that I thought about, grouping to see how many times one genre appeared throughout the decade, however, I came to the conclusion that showing the data in a year span was better to identify popularity and change over time, hence also the use of the bar chart to also show this change overtime. Similar projects analyzing music on spotify also tended to use hotmaps to show other data points such as how energetic the music was and attempted to prove the correlation it had to the amount of popularity it gained, however, there was no clear way to see that there was a correlation so it was not something I worried too much about. </p>
